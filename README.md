# runMongoAtlasVSC
Running mongoatlas in VisualStudioCode. For demo purposes.

## Preface

First of, my apologies for the weird and late Intital Commit. I never intended for this to be a big project 
so I didn't bother comitting it up on github. I was using it as a demo and troubleshooting platform on PyCharm. Then shifted it over to
Visual Studio Code (VSC). And here we are. 

So the purpose of this is mainly for my own practice but also as a sort of help site or what you want to call it. Along the way i'll put
up more stuff and make this fleshier. 

Thanks in advance everyone :)

## Introduction

The intention of this Git repo is hopefully to let others who are in need of help get some understanding of how one could run Flask with 
MongoDB on VSC. What this should cover would be the basic Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) and more if possibilities are there. 
First off, developers (I shall address everyone as developers from here on) should have a basic understanding on how to use the Integrated 
Development Environent (IDE). I have setup my VSC awhile back and can't seem to remember the full extensions that I have installed into
it. From what I can remember, I had Git Bash, python and Node.Js installed. You can do a little research on it before continuing on. Just search up "Installing ___ on VS Code." and you should get something. Maybe I would update those in the near future. 

At this point of time, I have already had Flask installed and my Mongo DB account activated. Activating MongoDB is quite straightforward, they would provide you with a one-off tutorial/checklist when you signup for one. 

As for Flask, you will have to ensure you have Python installed (as of writing, latest version would be Python 3). You can read through
these links and follow them:

 - [Installing Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/)
