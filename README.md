# runMongoAtlasVSC
Running mongoatlas in VisualStudioCode. For demo purposes.

## Preface

First of, my apologies for the weird and late Intital Commit. I never intended for this to be a big project 
so I didn't bother comitting it up on github. I was using it as a demo and troubleshooting platform on PyCharm. Then shifted it over to
Visual Studio Code (VSC). And here we are. 

So the purpose of this is mainly for my own practice but also as a sort of help site or what you want to call it. Along the way i'll put
up more stuff and make this fleshier. 

Thanks in advance everyone :)
